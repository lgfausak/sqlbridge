## dbbase.py - base database driver
##
## this is driver interface code.  It is used with the DB class.  It shouldn't
## be called or instantiated independent of that class.  Currently there are two
## drivers that use this code, postgres and mysql.  To add another database
## you can do so by subclassing this abstract class, overriding the methods,
## and adding the new class to db.py

    # connect
    #  simply connect to a database
    #  dsn is the only argument, it is a string, in psycopg2 connect
    #  format.  basically it looks like
    #  dbname=DBNAME host=MACHINE user=DBUSER
    #  DBNAME is the database name
    #  MACHINE is the ip address or dns name of the machine
    #  DBUSER is the user to connect as
    #

    # disconnect
    #   this disconnects from the currently connected database.  if no database
    #   is currently connected then this does nothing.

    # query:
    #  s - query to run (with dictionary substitution embedded, like %(key)s
    #  a - dictionary pointing to arguments.
    # example:
    #  s = 'select * from login where id = %(id)s'
    #  a = { 'id': 100 }
    # returns:
    #  dictionary result of query
    # note:
    #  there MUST be a result, otherwise use the operation call!
    #  well, the query can return 0 rows, that is ok.  but, if the query
    #  by its nature doesn't return any rows then don't use this call!
    #  for example, a query that says 'insert into table x (c) values(r)'
    #  by its nature it doesn't return a row, so, this isn't the right
    #  method to use, use operation instead
